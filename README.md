# Design 
* **Color scheme**: background-color: #000000 (black), white, and #85ffb6 (green)
    The colors are from the Studio 50 logo and are used throughout 
    for consistency. 

* **Typography**: The font is Mukta with sans-serif. I used this 
font as it is easy to read. 

* **Imagery**: The Studio 50 logo forms the main imagery of the page.
Other images include two stock pictures of clients. 

* **Wireframe**: [Wireframes.pdf](https://github.com/ckk-pls/Studio-50-2/files/5845572/Wireframes.pdf)

# Technology Used 
## Languages

* Bootsrap 

# Frameworks and programs uses
* [**Bootsrap v4.5**](https://getbootstrap.com/): Used for layout and positioning of elements and navigation bar.

* [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/): Used for importing fonts.

# Testing 
## Functionality Testing 
* **Header**: All page links bring you to the correct
section when clicked. On mobile devices the navbar collapses. 
All page links work when navbar is collapsed. 

* **Footer**: The footer contains four social media links. Each one links to an external page in a new tab. 
This was also tested on mobile.

* **Buttons**: The "sign up" button pops out when clicked. This was tested on desktop and mobile devices. Error messages also 
appear when the "sign up" form is not completed correctly. 

## Testing User Stories 
 **Gym user**
* On the landing page a gym user sees the brand name. They also 
see the price. 
* The gym user can then easily scroll down and see extra information.
* They see what other clients thought of Studio 50. 
* Then they see the timetable.
* They can then read what the gym is about with a sign up button underneath.
* They can then read about the trainers with a sign up buttoon underneath. Be able to navigate the website. 
* They can see the location on the map. 

**Returning Gym User**
* A returning gym user can use the nav bar to link to information
they might want to see. 
* A returning gym user can click on opening times, studio and location to
quickly find any information they may need. 

## Observations

* My mentor noticed that the timetable had a number of rows that repeated themselves in respect of the 
  of the opening times of the gym. In addition, I also inserted a square box around the fee amount so it would stand out. This
  was done on the advice of my mentor. I also increased the font size in the timetable and the features section in line with 
  my mentor's observations. 

* I tried to add a specific location on the map for the gym. I signed up for an API key with Google but when the link was copied
over it did not work. I discussed this with my mentor and we were unable to solve.

* I had a bug in relation to using bootstrap "table-center". It was creating a wide margin on the
mobile version of the website. I removed the bootstrap code which fixed the margin.
